// subtracted from it by the kernel. That is exactly what the in-place
// os.WriteFile this save path replaced produced, and reproducing it is the
// point -- publishing by rename is a durability change and should not quietly
// become a policy change about who may read the file.
//
// This test used to assert 0600, the mode os.CreateTemp hardcodes, and that
// assertion was itself the defect. Running the whole tool under sudo is
// blessed on macOS -- vm.checkDarwinPrivilege accepts euid 0 and its refusal
// says to re-run with sudo -- and the stock sudoers keeps HOME, so
// `sudo kairos-lab setup` resolves os.UserConfigDir to the invoking user's
// config dir and creates state.json there owned by root. At 0644 that file is
// still readable by the user afterwards. At 0600 it is not, and Store.Load
// falls back only for a file that is absent, never for one it may not open, so
// every later unprivileged command returns that error -- including `reset` and
// `cleanup`, the two a user would reach for to get out of it.
//
// Both directions are covered, because a mode handed to a create is a ceiling
// and not a floor: a permissive umask must not widen the file past 0644, and a
// restrictive one must still be obeyed rather than overridden.

// TestSaveReplacesASymlinkAtStatePath covers what the rename does when a
// symlink is sitting where state.json should be, and the two modes Save must
// not take from it.
//
// The rename replaces the link itself and leaves the file it pointed at
// untouched. That is a deliberate improvement on the in-place write this save
// path replaced, which followed the link and wrote through it: a link planted
// at a path this tool writes -- and on macOS it may be writing as root, into a
// directory the invoking user owns -- turned a save into a write to whatever
// the planter chose.
//
// The mode assertions are the other half of the same point. Since the link is
// replaced rather than written through, the mode of its target is the mode of
// nothing this function publishes, so it must not be carried onto the new
// file: os.Stat would hand it over, because it follows the link, which is why
// the carry uses os.Lstat. Nor may the link's own mode be carried -- 0777 on
// Linux, 0755 on macOS, neither of them anything a state file should be --
// which is what the IsRegular guard beside the Lstat is for. Either mistake
// surfaces here as a published mode that is not the 0644-minus-umask a create
// gives a file that did not exist.
