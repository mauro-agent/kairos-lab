// Tests for the host-networking paths in network_linux.go.
//
// There is deliberately no build tag here. network_linux.go carries none
// either: it compiles only on Linux by virtue of its _linux.go filename, and
// this file's name gives it the identical constraint. So these tests run on
// the ubuntu CI leg and are absent from the macOS one, which is what we want
// -- every symbol they touch exists only on Linux, and the darwin build of
// the package would not compile them.
//
// Almost nothing here goes near the host. sudo, bridgeSlaveLinks and the host
// probes beside them are package-level vars (see the comment above sudo);
// newFakeHost swaps them for an in-process fake that records the argv of
// every command the code would have handed to root, and restores the
// originals with t.Cleanup so no test can leak its fake into another. What
// the fake replaces is only ever a subprocess: findBridgeSlave, which decides
// which interface a teardown reconnects, is a plain function and runs for
// real in every test that reaches it.
//
// "Almost", because one test is a deliberate exception:
// TestTapOwnerUIDHonoursSudoUserFirst runs a real
// `id -u kairoslab-no-such-user` through uidForUser. Faking the resolver
// there would gut the test, whose entire claim is that an unresolvable
// SUDO_USER is an error and not a silent fall back to the current uid, which
// under sudo is root's -- only the real resolver can establish that. The
// subprocess is read-only, changes nothing on the host, and fails the same
// way everywhere, since the account it asks about is one no host has. No
// other test in this file starts a process.

// `os.Stat("/sys/class/net/<name>/bridge"); return err == nil`.
//
// `err == nil` is the whole predicate, so every stat error collapses to the
// one false. Measured against real os.Stat on this host:
//
//	okbr      err == nil is true    -- a bridge
//	eaccesbr  err == nil is false   -- permission denied
//	notdir    err == nil is false   -- not a directory
//	loop      err == nil is false   -- too many levels of symbolic links
//	gone      err == nil is false   -- no such file or directory

// is the only one that may skip the check.
//
// The rows below are those classes against the stat that replaced it, which
// asks about /sys/class/net/<name> and not about the "bridge" entry under
// it, and the path decides which of them a host really produces. Permission
// denied is the live one: a /sys/class/net this user cannot read answers
// EACCES for every name in it. ENOTDIR and ELOOP are here because the rule
// is "anything that is not ENOENT refuses" and the rule is what is being
// pinned, not a catalogue of today's kernels -- under the device path
// ENOTDIR needs /sys/class/net itself to be a non-directory, and a symlink
// loop is not reachable in sysfs. /sys/class/net/bonding_masters, the
// standing ENOTDIR example, is not one of these at all: it is a regular file
// directly in /sys/class/net, so the OLD path stats bonding_masters/bridge
// and gets ENOTDIR while this one stats bonding_masters itself and gets a
// clean "exists", after which the port check runs and refuses: `ip` has no
// port list for a name that is not a device, and refuseForeignBridgePort
// fails closed on a probe error.
//
// The host below is the sharpest form of it. `ip` works perfectly, eth0 is
// already a port of the bridge, and the stat is the only thing that cannot
// answer -- so with the gate in front of the checks the port list was never
// read at all, ipv4.method shared was applied over the NIC, and the start
