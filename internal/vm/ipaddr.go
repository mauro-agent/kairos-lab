// Finding the address of a running guest. The guest is on a bridge we built,
// it took a lease from a DHCP server we started (shared mode) or from the
// LAN's (bridged mode), and nothing told us what it got -- so the address has
// to be recovered from the host, keyed on the one thing we chose ourselves:
// the NIC address MACForDisk derived for this disk.
//
// Three sources answer that question, and they are tried in a fixed order
// that is about trustworthiness, not convenience:
//
//  1. the DHCP lease file -- OUR server's own record of what it handed out,
//     which makes it authoritative about a shared-mode guest and says nothing
//     at all about any other kind, so it is consulted in shared mode ONLY.
//     See Resolve for the gate and why widening it reports the wrong address;
//  2. the ARP/neighbour cache -- evidence the host has actually exchanged
//     frames with that MAC, which is one subprocess and needs no agent in the
//     guest, but ages out and can hold a stale entry from a previous boot.
//     This is the FIRST source in bridged mode, where the lease is held by a
//     DHCP server on the LAN that we have no file for;
//  3. the QEMU guest agent -- the guest's own answer, correct when it comes
//     but present only if the image ships qemu-guest-agent, and on macOS
//     usually unreachable (see guestAgentIP).
//
// Every source is best effort. A missing file, a denied read, a missing
// binary, a guest with no agent: each falls through to the next in silence,
// because none of them is an error the user did anything about. Resolve
// returning false means "not yet", and Poll exists because "not yet" is the
// normal answer for the first several seconds of a boot.

// Kairos live ISO to boot and request a lease, short enough that a user
// staring at a VM with no address learns so while they still care. Waiting
// longer does not help -- past that point the answer is a diagnostic, not
// more patience.
//
// A one-second tick is a budget for the sources and not just a sleep, and the
// guest agent is what spends it. Every tick that finds no address runs all
// three sources to completion: the lease read (no subprocess, microseconds),
// one ARP/neighbour subprocess, and then the guest agent -- which, because
// QEMU is always started with a guest-agent chardev and wait=off, ACCEPTS the
// connection even on a guest that ships no agent and then answers nothing, so
// it costs its full read timeout on every one of those ticks. That is why
// qgaReadTimeout is well under this interval: with the two at 2s and 1s the
